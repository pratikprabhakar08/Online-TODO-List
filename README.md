Online TODO List

This application is built using Spring Boot with Thymeleaf and I have also used Bootstrap library for the look and feel of a good Online To Do List application.

As Spring Boot gives us many advantages in comparison to other technology. Spring Boot doesn’t need any deployment of application to the Server. And Spring Boot is very popular and on-demand technology for any stand-alone application. 

In this application, I have used the MVC (Model View Controller) as the design pattern. I have used JPA for persistent of the data to allow the user to view.

This application has some of the below functionality:
•	The credential is hardcoded along with few predefine task. 
•	Any of the task can be editable, viewed and updated. 
•	Task Status have two level Completed and In Progress.
•	User can delete task using Task ID.
